# genomic-annotations
Single place for common genomic annotations that I keep manually re-generating

The UCSC table generation is really a great tool for this. 

See this thread: https://groups.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/forum/#!topic/genome/_l0aRC7b2L4

All this repo does in brute force download the annotations for hg38/mm10 because I need to use them so regularly.
